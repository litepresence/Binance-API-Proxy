Binance Public API Statistical Mode Response From Hundreds of Free Proxies


```
In the realm of tyrants and despots grim,
Geo-blocking is their feeble whim.
But we, the savvy and the sly,
Know how to outsmart and defy.

With proxies and VPNs as our guide,
We'll navigate their censorship with indignant pride.
Their attempts to control will be in vain,
As we hack circles around their digital domain.

Their walls of restriction we'll easily breach,
For knowledge and truth are within our reach.
No dictator can silence our voice,
For freedom and truth are our ultimate choice.

Geo-blocking is their tool of fear,
But we'll outsmart them without shedding a tear.
So let them try to control and oppress,
We'll hack and defy, we'll never regress.
